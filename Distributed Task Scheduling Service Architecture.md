# 🚀 Distributed Task Scheduler Service - System Architecture Overview

## 📌 Introduction
The **Distributed Task Scheduler Service** is designed to efficiently assign and manage tasks across a **scalable**, **fault-tolerant**, and **event-driven** architecture. It ensures seamless task execution while dynamically handling high traffic loads.

## 🛠️ Key Architectural Highlights
- ⚙️ **Microservices-Based & Event-Driven**  
- 📈 **Scalable Task Scheduling & Execution**  
- 💪 **Fault-Tolerant & Resilient Worker Pool**  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Worker Scaling with Auto-Healing**  
- 🔍 **Monitoring & Observability for Reliability**  

## 📜 High-Level Architecture
The system consists of the following core components:

- **Task Submission API**: Accepts job requests from clients.
- **Task Queue (Message Broker)**: Ensures reliable task distribution.
- **Scheduler Service**: Assigns tasks based on priority & availability.
- **Worker Pool**: Processes tasks efficiently in a fault-tolerant manner.
- **Event Bus**: Facilitates real-time updates & communication.
- **Storage Layer**: Maintains task metadata & execution history.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Tracks system performance & failures.

## 📊 System Workflow
1️⃣ **Task Submission**: Clients submit tasks via the API.  
2️⃣ **Task Queueing**: Tasks are enqueued in a **high-throughput message broker**.  
3️⃣ **Scheduling**: The **Scheduler** assigns tasks based on priority & worker availability.  
4️⃣ **Task Execution**: **Workers** execute tasks and update their status.  
5️⃣ **Monitoring & Failure Handling**: Ensures system resilience with retries, dead-letter queues, and auto-scaling.  

## 📌 Tech Stack Recommendations
- **Task Queue**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS  
- **Event Bus**: Kafka or NATS  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (sharded), DynamoDB, or Cassandra  
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for worker and scheduler scaling  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
